# Chew
A simple plugin that allows players to convert ALL seed bearing foods to seeds instantly.

Players will require permissions prior to using. chewfood.use

All the player has to do is have their choice of food to convert in their inventory.

In chat simply type type /chew

Server owners just drop it in and assign perms to groups and your set.

Given the extreme simplicity of the code this plugin should never require update

Unless I add an adjustable timer that adds a tiny delay after consuming each item stack.

If you have ConsumableEffects you can setup effects for when you consume per stack as well.
