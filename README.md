# Chew
A simple plugin that allows players to convert seed bearing foods to seeds quickly.

Players will require permissions prior to using. chewfood.use

All the player has to do is have thei choice of food to convert, in their inventory.

In chat simply type type /chew

I will add an adjustable timer for when consuming a stack of an item.

If you have ConsumableEffects you can setup effects for each type.
